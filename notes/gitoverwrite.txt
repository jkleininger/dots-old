git pull – force overwrite your code with remote or local changes

Conflicts can be troublesome when you do a git pull or git merge. What if you are pretty sure that you want to use the remote version or your version of the code during a pull/merge conflict? no “git pull -f” doesn’t do it.

To do it really quickly, you can
	
git fetch
git reset --hard origin/master




To have closer control and do it file by file.
	
git pull
# assuming conflicts occur with style.css at this moment.
# this forces me to use the remote file. use --ours to use my version.
git checkout --theirs style.css
git add style.css
git commit
