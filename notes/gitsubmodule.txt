in your project parent directory run:

git submodule update --init 

or if you have recursive submodules run:

git submodule update --init --recursive

sometimes this still doesn't work it is because somehow you have local changes in the local submodule directory while the submodule is being updated.

Most of the time the local change might not be the one you want to commit. It can happen due to a file deletion in your submodule etc. If so, do a reset in your local submodule directory and in your project parent directory run again:

git submodule update --init --recursive
